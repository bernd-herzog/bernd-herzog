### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a wireless cloud display that runs without batteries, is easy to install, requires no maintenance and will hopefully last at least 20 years out in the field.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the knowledge of mankind.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cyber security research in the rf domain.

Check out this cool open source hardware project which I gifted a huge set of new features while learning about embedded software and hardware: [portapack-mayhem](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware)
